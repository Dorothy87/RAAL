# RAAL

We save our experimental data as CSV files containing physical execution plan trees, real-time resources for Spark SQL, table structures involved, and associated execution costs. The experiment runs as follows.

1.	python data_processing.py

This step is the data pre-processing, including training the word vector model, processing the experimental data into npy or pkl type data.

2.	python train_and_test.py

This step is the training and testing of the RAAL model. We first use 80% of the pre-processed data for model training and then the remaining 20% for post-training model testing. The results of the runs are output directly after completion, including MSE, RE, COR, R2.

RAAL_model is the prominent architecture of our method. The folder "data_files" is for storing npy or pkl files generated by data pre-processing. The folder "result" is for storing each training iteration's results, including epoch, loss, mse, re, r2, cor, etc.
